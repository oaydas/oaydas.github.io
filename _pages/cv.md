## Experience

### Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan — Software Engineer Intern  
*Detroit, MI | May 2025 – Aug 2025*  
- Built an internal automation platform using Python and VBA to generate Excel-based RFP documents, eliminating 100+ hours of manual work per month and improving cross-team consistency.  
- Modernized mission-critical insurance logic by translating legacy COBOL systems into Java.  
- Created training materials adopted by 50+ teams for secure, governed use of enterprise AI tools.  

### Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan — Enterprise Technology Intern  
*Detroit, MI | May 2024 – Aug 2024*  
- Designed the roadmap for transitioning legacy benefits systems to a GenAI-powered, ChatGPT-like interface for natural language benefits lookup.  
- Built UiPath automation workflows and monitoring dashboards to track performance and reliability of enterprise-scale robotic process automation.  

### Resolute Building Intelligence — Software Intern  
*Troy, MI | May 2023 – Aug 2023*  
- Led a team of interns to develop a web application that organized and visualized data from 200+ GitHub repositories.  
- Automated large-scale Java and Gradle build upgrades using Python and Bash, reducing ongoing maintenance effort.


## Selected Projects

### Concurrent Systems Runtime (C++)  
*Oct 2025 – Nov 2025*  
- Implemented a multi-CPU runtime system with thread scheduling, synchronization, and safe context switching, modeled after operating system kernels.  
- Built a virtual memory subsystem supporting copy-on-write, shared memory, disk-backed paging, and clock-based page replacement.  
- Stress-tested correctness under heavy concurrency using multi-process workloads.
