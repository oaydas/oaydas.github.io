Hi, I’m **Ömer Aydaş**, a Computer Science student at the University of Michigan, currently completing my B.S.E. and continuing into a Master’s in Computer Science. I’m passionate about building systems that operate at scale, from low-level concurrent runtimes and operating-system–style infrastructure to machine learning pipelines and enterprise automation.

My experience spans both deep technical work and real-world impact. At Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, I worked on modernizing large legacy systems, helping translate mission-critical COBOL logic into Java and contributing to the design of a future GenAI-powered, ChatGPT-like interface for benefits lookup. I also built automation tools using Python, VBA, and UiPath that eliminated hundreds of hours of manual work each month and improved reliability across business teams.

On the systems side, I’ve built a full concurrent runtime in C++ that mimics operating system behavior, including multi-CPU scheduling, virtual memory with copy-on-write, and intelligent page replacement. I’ve also worked on data-driven projects such as ICU mortality prediction models achieving over 0.93 AUROC, and deep learning models using CNNs and Vision Transformers in PyTorch.

I enjoy working at the intersection of **systems, software, and applied AI**, especially where performance, correctness, and real user impact all matter. Long term, I’m excited about roles that combine strong technical depth with product thinking and leadership, and I’m always looking for opportunities to build technology that is both elegant under the hood and genuinely useful in practice.
